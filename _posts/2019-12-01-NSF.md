<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This is an NSF-funded project to develop models of powered-prosthetic user cognitive workload when applying different modes of electromyography (EMG)-based device control. Models are to be used for predicting workload associated with use of EMG-based control interfaces in other applications.

### 3.1 Project overview

<font size=3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
This project is to provide engineering and design guidance for EMG-based assistive human-machine interactions for human performance of basic psychomotor and real-time, high-demand control tasks. To achieve this goal, there are three experiments. Currently we have completed the first experiment, are working on the second experiment, and are preparing for the third experiment.<br/><br/>

<b> 1st EXPERIMENT</b><br/>

 To identify the differences in cognitive load in using various EMG-based HMIsï¼Œfirst experiment made comparison of direct-control device with EMG-response pattern-recognition control, and continuous control technology. Through two tasks, CRT and SHAP, user performance data, usability evaluations and workload surveys were collected. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/><b> 2nd EXPERIMENT</b><br/>

Second experiment makes assessment of use of EMG-based control interface with virtual reality-based simulation of prosthetic manipulations in activities of daily living. The schematic below shows the hardware setup for the experiment.  <br/><br/>

<br/><br/><b> 3rd EXPERIMENT</b><br/>
Final study will assess driver use of EMG-based control interface to perform basic driving tasks in high fidelity simulator. Work is expected to result in a set of design guidelines for EMG-based control interface designs for various applications. <br/><br/>
