<font size=3>Hi! I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://www.ufl.edu" target="_blank">University of Florida</a> in the  <a href="https://www.ise.ufl.edu" target="_blank">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.ise.ufl.edu/kaber/" target="_blank">Dr. David Kaber</a>. I expect to complete my degree in <i>June 2023</i>.<br/>

I am broadly interested in applying theories and principles of human factors in systems design and systems engineering to analysis, modeling and development of various human-in-the-loop systems to make them safer and more efficient.   <br/>
