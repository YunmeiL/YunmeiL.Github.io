:smile: &emsp;Hi! I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Florida, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in<br /> Human-Centered Computing under Dr. Jaime Ruiz. I graduated in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer<br /> Science from Seattle Pacific University.

Currently, my research focuses on communicating with computers through gesture interaction <br />and the use of expressive virtual agents. I am also developing an intelligent video annotation tool, <br />called EASEL, that uses gesture segmentation and recognition to automate and improve the process <br />of analyzing non-verbal gestures and intents in video. Please visit my projects page or the Ruiz <br />Lab website for more information about these and other projects.
