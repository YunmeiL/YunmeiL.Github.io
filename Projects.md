<font size=3>This is an NSF-funded project to develop models of powered-prosthetic user cognitive workload when applying different modes of electromyography (EMG)-based device control. Models are to be used for predicting workload associated with use of EMG-based control interfaces in other applications.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size=3>This a DARPA-funded project on the use of augmented reality for providing knowledge task guidance in extreme situations. The research challenge is to create a data-to-knowledge "pipeline" from wearable devices to an intelligent agency that can determine what information or guidance to provide to human operators in real-time.  <br/><br/><br/>

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size=3>This new three-year REU project entitled REU Site in Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain (AMSC) at the University of Louisville will provide a 10-week summer experiential training. REU students will work closely with faculty mentors on cutting-edge research projects that are motivated from real world problems. The AMSC REU students will also participate in professional development opportunities such as workshops, training sessions, research presentations, and plant tours. <br/><br/>

## 1. Research on Automation Rate and Situation Awareness Responses

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
<font size=3>During the operation of automated systems, if a user cannot accurately understand the structure and function of automation of the system, it is likely that distrust or over-trust in the automation will occur. To address this research gap, my dissertation research developed a continuous “automation rate (AR)” function to quantify levels of automation in complex  systems. In addition, I proposed a new relationship between the AR function and operator situation awareness responses, based on existing empirical research findings. <br/>

## 2. Roadway Signage for Novel Grade-separated Interchanges

<img height='200' width='300' align="right" src="assets/images/banners/dissertation0.png"/>
 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size=3>This is an NCDOT-funded project that used a driving simulator to compare the driving performance and mental state of young and middle-aged drivers while navigating standard intersections and novel GSI (contraflow and quadrant) conditions. The experiment also manipulated driver exposure to different configurations of lane assignment and decision point signs.  <br/><br/><br/>

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size=3>In addition to the above research studies, I have also been involved in other projects on systems safety analysis research, unmanned aerial vehicle interface design, consistency in the design of interchanges in high-density traffic corridors and non-safety-related in-vehicle and on-road message displays.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
