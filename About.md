<font size=3>
I am originally from Yantai, China. With distinct seasons and plenty of rainfall, my hometown is famous all over the country for its rich fruits such as apples and cherries. <br/><br/>
    
In 2012, I left my beautiful hometown to study industrial engineering at Shandong University; then I completed my bachelor's degree in 2016 and was admitted to Nanjing University as a graduate student with outstanding performance. I completed my master's degree through Nanjing University in 2019. During that degree, I developed an interest in research on the relationship between humans and systems. I subsequently applied to University of Florida and began studies in the fall of 2019. I have been involved in several research projects on transportation systems and assistive technologies, and has been working on a minor in statistics. <br/><br/>

<p>Outside of research, I love doing yoga and cooking. My friends say I'm gifted with Chinese food, but I currently see it as flattery.&#128516;</p>
