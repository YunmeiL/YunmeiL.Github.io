<!-- <h1 align="center">ABOUT</h1> -->
<font size=3>
Human-centric AI is an approach to artificial intelligence (AI) that places humans at the heart of its design, development, and deployment. It's about creating AI systems that understand and adapt to human needs and contexts, ensuring that technology enhances human capabilities. <br/><br/>

To achieve this, we are using wearable sensors to gather a wide range of data, including physiological signals like heart rate, skin conductance, and even brain activity, as well as performance metrics such as task completion time and error rates. By analyzing this rich dataset with machine learning and statistical methods, we can model human performance and behavior with remarkable accuracy. <br/><br/>

Human-Centric AI allows AI systems that not only understand our instructions but also our intentions, emotions, and limitations, paving the way for a future where human-AI collaboration is as natural and intuitive as human-human interaction.<br/><br/>

<!-- After completing my bachelor's degree in industrial engineering at Shandong University, I pursued my master's degree in the same field at Nanjing University. During my studies, I became interested in research on the relationship between humans and systems, which led me to pursue my Ph.D. studies at the University of Florida. I've been involved in several research projects on human-automation interaction, surface transportation and assistive technologies, and I'm also working on a minor in statistics.<br/><br/> -->

<!-- <p>When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy practicing yoga and cooking. My friends say I'm a pro at making Chinese food, but I'm still learning and getting better every day. In my spare time, I also love to try new recipes and experiment with different flavors. Thanks for getting to know me! &#128516;</p> -->
