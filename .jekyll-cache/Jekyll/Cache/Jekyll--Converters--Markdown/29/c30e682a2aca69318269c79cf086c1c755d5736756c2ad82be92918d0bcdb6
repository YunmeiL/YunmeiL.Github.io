<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This is an NSF-funded project to develop models of powered-prosthetic user cognitive workload when applying different modes of electromyography (EMG)-based device control. Models are to be used for predicting workload associated with use of EMG-based control interfaces in other applications.
