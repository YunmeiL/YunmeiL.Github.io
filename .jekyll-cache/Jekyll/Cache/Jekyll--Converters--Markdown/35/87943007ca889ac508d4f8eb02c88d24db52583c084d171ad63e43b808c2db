During the operation of automated systems, if a user cannot accurately understand the structure and function of automation of the system, it is likely that distrust or over-trust in the automation will occur. To address this research gap, my dissertation research developed a continuous “automation rate” function to quantify levels of automation in complex  systems. In addition, I proposed a new relationship between the AR function and operator situation awareness responses, based on existing empirical research findings.
