<font size="3">During the operation of automated systems, if a user cannot accurately understand the structure and function of automation of the system, it is likely that distrust or over-trust in the automation will occur. To address this research gap, my dissertation research developed a continuous ‚Äúautomation rate (AR)‚Äù function to quantify levels of automation in complex  systems. In addition, I proposed a new relationship between the AR function and operator situation awareness responses, based on existing empirical research findings. <br />

<font size="3">This is an NCDOT-funded project that used a driving simulator to compare the driving performance and mental state of young and middle-aged drivers while navigating standard intersections and novel GSI (contraflow and quadrant) conditions. The experiment also manipulated driver exposure to different configurations of lane assignment and decision point signs.  <br /><br /><br />

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size="3">This is an NSF-funded project to develop models of powered-prosthetic user cognitive workload when applying different modes of electromyography (EMG)-based device control. Models are to be used for predicting workload associated with use of EMG-based control interfaces in other applications.  <br /><br /><br /><br />

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">

<font size="3">This a DARPA-funded project on the use of augmented reality for providing knowledge task guidance in extreme situations. The research challenge is to create a data-to-knowledge "pipeline" from wearable devices to an intelligent agency that can determine what information or guidance to provide to human operators in real-time.  <br /><br /><br />

<font size="3">In addition to the above research studies, I have also been involved in other projects on systems safety analysis research, unmanned aerial vehicle interface design, consistency in the design of interchanges in high-density traffic corridors and non-safety-related in-vehicle and on-road message displays.  <br /><br /><br /><br />
