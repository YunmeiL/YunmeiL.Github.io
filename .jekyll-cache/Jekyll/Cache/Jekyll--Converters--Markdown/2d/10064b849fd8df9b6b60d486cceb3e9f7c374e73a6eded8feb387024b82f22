This is an NCDOT-funded project that used a driving simulator to compare the driving performance and mental state of young and middle-aged drivers while navigating standard intersections and novel GSI (contraflow and quadrant) conditions. The experiment also manipulated driver exposure to different configurations of lane assignment and decision point signs.

     My contributions in this project including:
     <ul>

         <li>Designed situation awareness queries to collect the situation awareness data of subjects at different interchanges and different signage configurations.</li>

         <li>Programmed Qualtrics surveys to render it in the desired format and convert output to spreadsheet file formats.</li>

         <li>Designed and conducted human factors experiment on effects of grade-separated interchange geometry and traffic control device design on driver visual behavior and performance.</li>

         <li>Post-processing and analysis of experimental data on subjects' situational awareness, mental load, driving performance, and eye trackers were performed using Python. In addition, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted on all these responses.</li>

         <li>Constructed four machine learning classification models to analyze and predict erroneous driver actions at novel interchange configurations given driverâ€™s status. </li>

     </ul>
