In addition to the above research studies, I have also been involved in other projects on systems safety analysis research, unmanned aerial vehicle interface design,consistency in the design of interchanges in high-density traffic corridors and non-safety-related in-vehicle and on-road message displays.

Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) has realized substantial application for safety engineering; however, the method is not without limitations in comparison to other safety analysis techniques. Traditional FTA requires substantial time and effort even for single fault assessment including determining probability of occurrence. A constrained literature review and examination of functions available in commercial-off-the-shelf FTA software revealed current implementations to lack a structured functional approach to account for the severity of intermediate events to a fault as well as the severity of fault outcomes. To address this specific limitation, a novel Consequence Severity-Probability Importance Measure (CSPIM) is proposed for extension of static FTA. An algorithm is presented to achieve the CSPIM within FTA. In addition, we present a case study to make comparison of traditional FTA with the use of CSPIM within FTA. Results demonstrated that CSPIM effectively integrates a severity analysis feature in FTA and allows for risky events to be prioritized for safety controls, based on the measure.<br />
